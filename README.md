# Optimization of an algorithm
Optimization of an algorithm in the subject of Design and Analysis of Algorithms, seeking better efficiency in an algorithm for calculating numbers in a matrix.

## Application

#### 1Ô∏è - Algorithmn [`(main.c)`](https://github.com/brunofaria27/optimization-of-an-algorithm/blob/main/versions_main/main_1.c) -  Teacher Alexei Machado
This code is a C program that calculates a 2D matrix of float values, given a binary data file, number of rows and number of columns as inputs. The code calculates the matrix by performing various mathematical operations on the elements of the input data file.

#### üìã Functionalities
1. Reads a binary data file and stores its elements into a 2D matrix.
2. Performs mathematical operations on the elements of the matrix, including sin and cosine calculations, exponentiation, and logarithm.
3. Saves the output matrix into a text file.
4. Measures the execution time of the code and prints it to the console.

#### ‚û°Ô∏è Input
The input consists of three parameters:
- The name of the binary data file.
- The number of rows of the 2D matrix.
- The number of columns of the 2D matrix.

#### ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Output
The output is a text file containing the resulting 2D matrix of float values. The execution time of the code is also printed to the console.

#### üñá Functions
The code contains four functions:

- `ReadElement` - Reads a single element from the binary data file and returns it.
- `DetSinCos` - Calculates the sine and cosine values of an element and stores the results in the pointers passed as parameters.
- `DetOutput` - Calculates the output values for a given element, using the sine and cosine values calculated by the `DetSinCos` function.
- `main` - The main function of the program, which contains the code for reading the binary data file, performing the mathematical operations, saving the output matrix to a text file, and measuring the execution time.

#### üìí Notes
- The code assumes that the binary data file is not corrupt and contains only valid elements. If the file is corrupt, the program will print a message and exit with error code -1.
- The code uses the `malloc` function to allocate memory dynamically for the 2D matrix. If there is not enough memory available, the program will print a message and exit with error code -1.
- The code uses the `clock` function from the `time.h` library to measure the execution time.
- The code defines the constant `PI` with the value of 3.141592.
- The code saves the output matrix to a text file named "real_values.txt".

#### 2Ô∏è - Algorithm [`(generateFile.c)`](https://github.com/brunofaria27/optimization-of-an-algorithm/blob/main/generateFile.c)
This algorithm is auxiliary and generates a file with `n x m` random values between `0` and `255` in byte. Just pass the name of file `name_file` and number of values `n = lines` and `m = columns` as a parameter in the terminal during the compilation time.

-------------------

## üöÄ Run Code
To run the code, just have the [**MinGW**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) compiler on your machine and use the following commands:

- Generate the file to be sent to main 
```bash 
$ g++ generateFile.cpp -o generate.exe
$ ./generate.exe <number of rows> <number of columns>
````
- Run the main program and save the result to a file
```bash 
$ gcc main.c -o main.exe
$ ./generate.exe randomValues.txt <number of rows> <number of columns>
````

## üìà Code for drawing graphics [**(graphics.py)**](https://github.com/brunofaria27/optimization-of-an-algorithm/blob/main/graphics.py)
This code using Jupyter Notebook, using the **matplotlib.pyplot** library. Which generates four different types of graphs for the test arrays, always in relation to the size of the file or matrix in relation to the execution time of the algorithm [`(main.c)`](https://github.com/brunofaria27/optimization-of-an-algorithm/blob/main/versions_main/main_1.c).
